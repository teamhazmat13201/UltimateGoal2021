/**
 * Defenition of the HzGamepad Class
 *
 * HzGamepad consists of system provided gamepad(s) and adds functionality to the selection 
 * made on gamepads
 * 
 * For Hazmat Skystone, only one Gamepad is used (gamepad1)
 *
 * The controls are as follows:
 *      Left Stick for pan motion (gamepad1.left_stick_x and gamepad1.left_stick_y)
 *      Right Stick for turn motion (only uses the x direction : gamepad1.right_stick_y)
 *      Right Bumper for increasing level of arm by 1 block (gamepad1.right_bumper)
 *      Left Bumper for decreasing level of arm by 1 block (gamepad1.left_bumper)
 *      Right Trigger for increasing speed to double (gamepad1.right_trigger)
 *      Button A to close / pull back linear actuator Intake-Grp (gamepad1.a)
 *      Button Y to open / extend linear actuator Intake-Grip (gamepad1.y)
 *      Button X to move Arm to place block at level (gamepad1.x)
 *      Button B to move Arm to lift after block placement (gamepad1.b)
 *      Button Dpad_up to open wrist (gamepad1.dpad_up)
 *      Button Dpad_down to close wrist (gamepad1.dpad_down)
